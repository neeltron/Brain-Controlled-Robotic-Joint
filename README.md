# Brain-Controlled-Robotic-Joint

Amputees face physical and emotional challenges in their day-to-day life, and their struggle is immeasurable. To solve this problem, I'm presenting a robotic joint, that can be used as a limb (once combined with prosthetics) and can help them control an artificial arm or leg using their brain. Although the headset contains only a single channel, it can still be a stepping stone to cutting-edge technology.
